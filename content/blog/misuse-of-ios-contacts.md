When developing a product, it's really easy to get stuck in a build, build, build mindset. You try to see the product from the user's perspective and add features and tools that would help you as a user.

The user is resilient; the user is smart. Within the constraints of your product, they find a way to mutate and *misuse* a program to fit their specific needs.

This was meant to be a single blog post about multiple technologies and examples of misuse but they all deserve to be stories on their own. 

## The iOS Contacts app

I would argue that the contacts app on iOS may be the most decrepit one on the platform. Since Steve Jobs presented it on stage in 2007, no "major innovations" have occurred. The app is a linear list of alphabetically sorted contacts saved by the user.

There are a lot of fields you can customize (Company, Address, Website, &c) but when the user sees a contact they see three things: First Name, Last Name and a photo. 20 feet out, this is all you need to identify a person. This constraint has facilitated *misuse* of contacts. 

### Here are some of my favorite examples:

*Ryan Tinder vs. Ryan Work *

You _can_ fill out the company section on someone's contact information but that's not what you see when sending a message or making a phone call. Because of this, people replace the last name with an identifying feature. You don't know Ryan Davis, you know Ryan from Tinder.

*WORK (ANSWER ANSWER ANSWER ANSWER ANSWER) *

How do you save the number of the store you work at? They don't have a first name and last name. Furthermore, you want to add a sense of urgency. Putting in your store's number as ALL CAPITOL LETTERS alarms you. If you're getting a call from your store, you should be alarmed. You either slept through your shift, got fired, or need to come in ASAP.

*tucker european, tucker iphone, tucker, tucker 12/10/16, tucker 12/22/16, ...*

My brother has changed his number... a lot. I _could have_  deleted his current number and added a new one but, as some of these numbers were temporary, I needed a history of current, previous, and future phone numbers. Furthermore, if I appended each new number to his contact, what would happen when I hit call? Which number is _his_ number?

*no contact at all*

Sometimes it's too much work to save a contact. This is especially true when dating around or conversing with people for a short amount of time. For some people, it's easier to associate some parts of the number with a person than to save a new contact. Maybe there's a permanence to contacts that causes you to be reluctant to add in new people.

*all lower case, no last name and no image*

Harking back to the permanence of contacts, the contacts in my phone is a rolling list of acquaintances all the way back to my middle school days with my iPod Touch 2g. Back then, I liked the aesthetic of all lowercase characters and no last names. My iPod also had no camera. Because of that, almost a decade later, every new contact I add is in lowercase and (usually) forgoes a last name and image. In iOS 13, Apple started sharing contact cards. These contact cards have images, First Names, Last Names and proper capitalization. Because of that, I refuse to add in these new contact cards.

*add your contact in via the phone app *

> p1: Hey can I get your number?  

> p2: Yeah sure  

> p1: [Opens the Phone app] Here, put it in  


Look at the difference in adding a contact in through the Phone app versus the Contacts app. Giving someone your number by adding a contact into someone else's phone adds unnecessary complexity. "Do they know my last name?", "Should I put an emoji next to my name?", "Do I add a photo?"... Because of this, a lot of people just open the phone app and make you put in their number. After typing in your number, you hand the phone back and _they_ fill out the contact card.

#### Why?

Products today automate more and more processes from the user. On most social media platforms you are stuck with the name that person wants you to see, Medium chooses a font, weight and size for you, TikTok decides what you like and what to show you, Google Photos makes automatic albums and categories, etc. This automation limits user freedom. When a user is _forced to_ organize their own data, they find clever ways to solve their problems within the limitations.
