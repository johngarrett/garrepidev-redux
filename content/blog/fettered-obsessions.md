The environment surrounding me serves as a consistent reminder -- the goals, the dreams, the _obsessions_, I craft are forever frozen in an eternal state of immaturity. 

*To my immediate left*: raspberry pi's, tools, floppy drives, circuit boards, and post-it notes; all fossils of a previous attempts; of previous obsessions. 

*Center stage*: a desk I rarely work at. A second monitor full of never changing, unimportant, content. An incomplete Linux desktop, missing a basic file viewer, using a broken compositing, containing unmounted hard drives, leveraging segmented accounts, and owning countless security flaws.

*To my right*: the rest of my room exists; I work by the furthest window. I see a couch I built but never use. Next to it, a desk I never sit at. Upon that desk, a map of Atlanta I've yet to complete. On my parallel wall, a bookcase: 5 cameras, a motor, an 8-track, more tools, and some medicine. All under a blanket of dust and neglect. To its right -- maybe worst of all -- is every other offspring long gone from my brain. A Macintosh SE, a stack of laptops, PS2 games (I can't even complete video games. Entertainment!), textbooks, notebooks, unscanned film, a typewriter... my view is obscured so, honestly, I don't know what else exists in that corner. 

*On my devices*: scattered photos; fragmented stories, songs, and ideas; unkempt git repositories; rot. Duolingo, unread emails, deleted texts, academic papers. I can't even quantify what I've lost. 

I used to always quote `Poena Damni`, the fear of the unknown. Well, upon Googling, it actually means `the loss of the vision of God`. Maybe that's more fitting. The loss of something to believe in; the loss of hope; the lost of foundation.

- I used to dream of space -- I can't identify any constellations.
- I've studied and observed music -- no notes, lyrics, or sound scapes have been forged from my hands.
- I love language, the way it can shape you thoughts and craft your personality -- an octal digit can outnumber the books I've read.

I find myself falling, head over heals, for anyone who shows me an ounce of compassion in my life. That's not even the truth, the real commonality is... existence?. If you exist in my life, there's a good chance I've developed some bastardized love interest for you.

For what? For why? Why do I keep paving these paths just to leave it unfinished and dilapidated? I don't have an answer but, at least, in writing this, I can quantify the scope of abandonment time's progressions yields. That doesn't assume the ownership I want it to -- it isn't time's fault for progressing, it's my fault for allowing that progression to wash over me.
