At a glance, it's simple -- it's an algorithm that's fed a slew of data about a user to provide a customized feed. But, once you start interacting with the app, (and espeically start creating content on the app), you begin to realize it's more nuanced than that.\nThe reach of a creator's content is soley decided and execute by TikTok. The main feed, the For You Page, is populated by an algorithm not a list of subscribed, followed, or friended users.\nCreators experience periods of amazing growth and \"virality\". Then, almost at random, this can be taken away.\nIf you've used TikTok for any extended period of time, you may have seen a creator say something along the lines of:\n\n\"I've been shadowbanned, if you see this video please interact with it!\"\n\nCreators have begun to refer to this dip in engagement as being \"shadowbanned\". Based on what they've observerd and how their own consumption in the app works, the obvious solution is to ask viewers to interact with you content; somehow try and feed the algorithm positive cues about your content.\nAs an aside, one of my favorite calls to action I've seen is\n\n\"If you see this, hit share -&gt; other -&gt; copy link\"\n\nThis is because, I assume, TikTok doesn't know how to weight that interaction. They override buttons for sharing via messages, snapchat, twitter, etc. but once you hit other (and open the system default share sheet) they can't track what you do from there. All they can see is success or failure. If you copy the link, it's a \"success\"; if you hit cancel, it's a \"failure\". A sucesful share is most likely a positive input to the algorithm.\n\nAvoiding auto moderation\nThat has very little to do with what I'm writing about today but it sets a good stage. Creators walk on egg shells to avoid upsetting the algorithm -- they don't want to send any wrong signals. From a Human-Computer Interaction point of view this is amazing but, again, not directly related to the following.\nMany creators, rightfully, believe certain words (traditional curse words, political speech, etc.) can decrease their viewership or outright take down their videos.\nWhether this is true or not, creators have begun to use aliases for these words to avoid these automatic filters.\nHere are some (explicit) examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnotably, oui'd is a common tiktok alias for weed\n\n\n\nThis isn't a new phenomenon, twitter user's often use astricks to hide their tweet from search results. That makes sense; they're hiding from other users searching specific key words.\nTikTok is different. Allegedly, the algortihm runs OCR on each video to moderate and propogate content (notably, if the user creates the video within the app, TikTok could have access to the raw string and attach it to the metadata).\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/avoiding-the-tik-tok-moderation/","title":"Avoiding TikTok's auto moderation"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/fettered-obsessions/":{"body":"The environment surrounding me serves as a consistent reminder -- the goals, the dreams, the obsessions, I craft are forever frozen in an eternal state of immaturity. \nTo my immediate left: raspberry pi's, tools, floppy drives, circuit boards, and post-it notes; all fossils of a previous attempts; of previous obsessions. \nCenter stage: a desk I rarely work at. A second monitor full of never changing, unimportant, content. An incomplete Linux desktop, missing a basic file viewer, using a broken compositing, containing unmounted hard drives, leveraging segmented accounts, and owning countless security flaws.\nTo my right: the rest of my room exists; I work by the furthest window. I see a couch I built but never use. Next to it, a desk I never sit at. Upon that desk, a map of Atlanta I've yet to complete. On my parallel wall, a bookcase: 5 cameras, a motor, an 8-track, more tools, and some medicine. All under a blanket of dust and neglect. To its right -- maybe worst of all -- is every other offspring long gone from my brain. A Macintosh SE, a stack of laptops, PS2 games (I can't even complete video games. Entertainment!), textbooks, notebooks, unscanned film, a typewriter... my view is obscured so, honestly, I don't know what else exists in that corner. \nOn my devices: scattered photos; fragmented stories, songs, and ideas; unkempt git repositories; rot. Duolingo, unread emails, deleted texts, academic papers. I can't even quantify what I've lost. \nI used to always quote Poena Damni, the fear of the unknown. Well, upon Googling, it actually means the loss of the vision of God. Maybe that's more fitting. The loss of something to believe in; the loss of hope; the lost of foundation.\n\nI used to dream of space -- I can't identify any constellations.\nI've studied and observed music -- no notes, lyrics, or sound scapes have been forged from my hands.\nI love language, the way it can shape you thoughts and craft your personality -- an octal digit can outnumber the books I've read.\n\nI find myself falling, head over heals, for anyone who shows me an ounce of compassion in my life. That's not even the truth, the real commonality is... existence?. If you exist in my life, there's a good chance I've developed some bastardized love interest for you.\nFor what? For why? Why do I keep paving these paths just to leave it unfinished and dilapidated? I don't have an answer but, at least, in writing this, I can quantify the scope of abandonment time's progressions yields. That doesn't assume the ownership I want it to -- it isn't time's fault for progressing, it's my fault for allowing that progression to wash over me.\n\nThe Loss of the Vision of God\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/fettered-obsessions/","title":"Fettered Obsessions"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ipad-computing/":{"body":"Preface\nI've wanted an iPad since the iPad 2 came out. There aren't many tangible reasons why, it just scratched an itch somewhere in my brain. It wasn't until 2018, the end of my freshman fall semester (5 years later), that I managed to buy one -- a first generation iPad Pro.\nIt was disappointing, full stop. I wanted more out of this machine. Here's how I, as a student, have contorted my iPad to fit my world.\nSide Note: I've taken a year off university, so the examples below aren't reflective of new features, apps, online learning, etc.\niPadOS 13.4\nIn a podcast, Paul Miller once said something along the lines of:\n\n\"if a computer is a bicycle, then an iPad is a skateboard\"\n\nI would amend his amendment by saying an iPad is a penny board and not so much a skateboard. You can only do a few tricks, and you look kind of dorky using it, but it's an amazing cruiser.\nMy current iPad Pro (2nd Gen 10.5\") only gets upgraded when a jailbreak is available; a jailed iPad doesn't provide the same illusion of freedom.\nin the wild\nWindowing\n\nI use a tweak called MilkyWay that lets you window applications. Imagine windowing in it's worst state, that's what this is.\nHere's where I find it useful:\n\nwatching live lectures and taking notes at the same time \nfloating zoom on top while I navigate around elsewhere\nalways accessible Spotify\n\nthink: iTunes Mini Player\n\n\n\n\"Development\"\n\nI've managed to do a surprising amount of coding on my iPad. The image above is all native! I've installed some of the basics: python3, pip, npm, git, tmux, vim, &amp;c.\nSadly, I haven't managed to get cargo or swift working. I hope rustc's port to the ARM Macs does something for me.\nRanger, a favorite CLI tool of mine, compiles and installs pretty well. All of my vim, zsh, and tmux configurations (including plugins surprisingly) work here too. \nNewTerm2 is one of the two (maybe three) terminal emulators offered on the cydia store. Truly, it kind of sucks. Graphical errors are common, you can't remap keys (iPad Keyboards don't usually have an escape button), the color scheme &amp; font can't be updated, so on and so forth†.\nThere is also an app UTM that lets you virtualize operating systems on iOS. I mainly use this to run console only Arch Linux for when I need to use certain tools and binaries I don't have natively.\nMisc\na few more things the iPad is great at:\n\n\nphoto editing\n\n100x faster than my base line 2015 13\" MBP\n\n\n\ndrawing\n\n\nreading academic papers, textbooks, and articles\n\n\nThere are a bunch more tweaks and apps I use but I'm cutting it short.\nForm Factor\n\nEach time I pick up my iPad, I'm seeing it for the first time again. It's the computer I want to love. \nA few things on that:\n\nMagnets \n\nThe magnets allow me to stick it to a slew of surfaces -- chalkboards, stovetops, and train windows. I have strips of metal glued on walls throughout my house allowing me to hang it like a frame.\n\nScreen Protector\n\nDuring school, I'm writing, sketching, and annotating all day. Nothing is more indicative of this than the 3 Pencil tips I've eroded through. With a 20-something dollar \"paper\" screen protector, stylus input feel s great -- I never got the appeal of writing on a glass screen.\n\nText Input\n\nThe iPhone sized keyboard is great, it's unobtrusive and allows swipe gestures. Using the full size screen keyboard makes me feel like Sam Flynn but my accuracy is very poor (I've found myself typing on the eastern keys with my right hand and the western side with my apple pencil simultaniously).\nI tried the keyboard + trackpad case from Logetic and hated it. The external keyboard I use is a bluetooth one stripped from a 2010 iPad case. \n\nSummary\nI summed it all up earlier -- the iPad is the computer I want to love.\nI want its form factor, its speed, its battery life, to fit my needs. \nIt doesn't.\nAll that being said, a day in which I use my iPad is a good day.\nFootnotes\n†: you can use any ssh client off the App Store and connect to localhost. This would solve a lot of the problems (Terminus is way better than anything on cydia) but I haven't spent the time to do so yet\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ipad-computing/","title":"iPad Computing - A student's point of view"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/misuse-of-ios-contacts/":{"body":"When developing a product, it's really easy to get stuck in a build, build, build mindset. You try to see the product from the user's perspective and add features and tools that would help you as a user.\nThe user is resilient; the user is smart. Within the constraints of your product, they find a way to mutate and misuse a program to fit their specific needs.\nThis was meant to be a single blog post about multiple technologies and examples of misuse but they all deserve to be stories on their own. \nThe iOS Contacts app\nI would argue that the contacts app on iOS may be the most decrepit one on the platform. Since Steve Jobs presented it on stage in 2007, no \"major innovations\" have occurred. The app is a linear list of alphabetically sorted contacts saved by the user.\nThere are a lot of fields you can customize (Company, Address, Website, &amp;c) but when the user sees a contact they see three things: First Name, Last Name and a photo. 20 feet out, this is all you need to identify a person. This constraint has facilitated misuse of contacts. \nHere are some of my favorite examples:\n*Ryan Tinder vs. Ryan Work *\nYou can fill out the company section on someone's contact information but that's not what you see when sending a message or making a phone call. Because of this, people replace the last name with an identifying feature. You don't know Ryan Davis, you know Ryan from Tinder.\n*WORK (ANSWER ANSWER ANSWER ANSWER ANSWER) *\nHow do you save the number of the store you work at? They don't have a first name and last name. Furthermore, you want to add a sense of urgency. Putting in your store's number as ALL CAPITOL LETTERS alarms you. If you're getting a call from your store, you should be alarmed. You either slept through your shift, got fired, or need to come in ASAP.\n\nHonorable mentions from my contacts book: WELLS FARGO, UBER, DOORDASH\n\ntucker european, tucker iphone, tucker, tucker 12/10/16, tucker 12/22/16, ...\nMy brother has changed his number... a lot. I could have  deleted his current number and added a new one but, as some of these numbers were temporary, I needed a history of current, previous, and future phone numbers. Furthermore, if I appended each new number to his contact, what would happen when I hit call? Which number is his number?\nno contact at all\nSometimes it's too much work to save a contact. This is especially true when dating around or conversing with people for a short amount of time. For some people, it's easier to associate some parts of the number with a person than to save a new contact. Maybe there's a permanence to contacts that causes you to be reluctant to add in new people.\nall lower case, no last name and no image\nHarking back to the permanence of contacts, the contacts in my phone is a rolling list of acquaintances all the way back to my middle school days with my iPod Touch 2g. Back then, I liked the aesthetic of all lowercase characters and no last names. My iPod also had no camera. Because of that, almost a decade later, every new contact I add is in lowercase and (usually) forgoes a last name and image. In iOS 13, Apple started sharing contact cards. These contact cards have images, First Names, Last Names and proper capitalization. Because of that, I refuse to add in these new contact cards.\n*add your contact in via the phone app *\n\np1: Hey can I get your number?\n\n\np2: Yeah sure\n\n\np1: [Opens the Phone app] Here, put it in\n\nLook at the difference in adding a contact in through the Phone app versus the Contacts app. Giving someone your number by adding a contact into someone else's phone adds unnecessary complexity. \"Do they know my last name?\", \"Should I put an emoji next to my name?\", \"Do I add a photo?\"... Because of this, a lot of people just open the phone app and make you put in their number. After typing in your number, you hand the phone back and they fill out the contact card.\nWhy?\nProducts today automate more and more processes from the user. On most social media platforms you are stuck with the name that person wants you to see, Medium chooses a font, weight and size for you, TikTok decides what you like and what to show you, Google Photos makes automatic albums and categories, etc. This automation limits user freedom. When a user is forced to organize their own data, they find clever ways to solve their problems within the limitations.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/misuse-of-ios-contacts/","title":"The Misuse of the iOS Contacts"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/the-iphone-3gs-in-2020/":{"body":"\nWhy\nEvery so often, I find myself unable to control phone usage. That is, I spend hours a day aimlessly scrolling through social media while avoiding important calls, texts, and work. \nI've tried different solutions:\nturning off biometrics to slow down login,\nrigid screen time limits,\nhaving my roommate be the sole proprietor of my passcode,\netc. \nAt the end of the day, having a $1,000 iPhone makes me want to use it as a $1,000 iPhone...\nAll of that's beside the point. The solution, for me, is to periodically downgrade to an older iPhone every few months. This both breaks my bad habits and curbs my desire for buying a new phone.\nIn the past, my go to phone was an iPhone 5. With the surplus of phones I have, I decided to go a little further back this time.\n\n\nthe phone shelf\n\nAddendum\nReddit user daniel_dunphy gave me some great tips that nullify some complaints I bring up later on.\n\nsigning in with iCloud\n\nThe App Specific Password route I went wasn't the right thing to do. Instead, you combine your password with the verification code generated on another device. I remembered doing this before! For some reason, I couldn't find that solution this time around.\n\nDownloading older apps\n\niOS 6 does let you download older app versions from the App Store, like I suspected, but you have to have downloaded that app previously with your Apple Id. \nTo download a compatible version, you sign into the App Store, navigate to the \"Purchased\" section and download the apps from there. \nGiven this, a lot of my iCloud &amp; app related issues below are no longer valid. Keep that in mind if you're considering to do this yourself.\nForm Factor\nI won't belabor this, we all remember what an iPhone 3GS looks like. It's round and plastic, the screen has a handful of pixels while being recessed under 20 layers of laminate, and there's only one rear camera (with no flash).\nThe stark contrast between this and the iPhone 4 never fails to amaze me though. I can't think of a parallel leap, in the span of a year, that compares.\n\nThis phone wobbles when using it on a surface, way more than any iPhone with a camera bump. \nThe 30 pin connector is a thorn my rose tinted glasses obscured. It's cumbersome, uni-directional, and feels like inserting RAM into a motherboard every time you plug it in.\nSetup\nStep 1 -- SIM Card\nWith my iPhone X, I'm have a nano sim; the 3GS uses a standard SIM. To use my current phone plan, we have to jump back 3 generations, nano -&gt; micro -&gt; standard. Some electrical tape and scissors managed to do the trick.\n\nStep 2 -- restoring\nRestoring from a brand new iOS 6.1.6 IPSW was dead simple on MacOS 11. Plug it in, hit restore, done. \n\nStep 3 -- Setup\niOS 5 was the first iOS that was \"Computer Free\"; you didn't need a computer with iTunes to guide you through the setup process. I wish this weren't the case, however, because iCloud signin is effectively broken. \nThis OS predates the two-factor authentication mandate that iCloud now enforces. Easy enough, I'll just have to generate a one-time, app specific, password. No dice. The setup asserts incorrect Apple ID or password no matter what you try. Creating a new iCloud on device doesn't work, resetting the password doesn't work, etc. Fine, no iCloud. \nStep 4 -- iMessage\niCloud login, with that one-time passcode, works here for some reason. Sweet, I can send and receive iMessages (the main reason I'm downgrading to an iPhone and not an Android or Blackberry).\nStep 5 -- SpringBoard\nNow that Setup.app has run its course, what can we do? Well without iCloud I don't have any contacts so I don't know who to call or text.\nAll my notes in iCloud aren't compatible with devices below iOS 9 (even if I could sync them).\nThe weather and stock apps don't work either, I'm assuming their REST APIs have changed.\n\n\nApple Maps works as well as it ever has, down to the turn by turn navigation.\n\nAll the other preloaded apps work. Mail, Camera, Reminders, etc.\nJailbreaking\nI'm including all this because I believe it's a crucial step to using these older iPhones in the modern day.\nApp Store login doesn't work either. Even if it did, iOS 6 doesn't let you download older versions of apps that are compatible with your phone (I believe iOS 7+ does). Fine, I'll jailbreak it.\nHere are my options: \n\n\np0sixpwn\n\n\nH3lix\n\n\nevasi0n\n\n\nNone of these work on MacOS 11, of course, because of lack of 32 bit support.\nLinux support is out of the question as well.\np0sixpwn and evasi0n on a 2009 MacBook Pro\nNeither of these worked. p0sixpwn couldn't find the device and evasi0n just caused the phone to reboot and nothing more. This is most likely an iTunes issue but with the age of the laptop, I was stuck.\np0sixpwn on Windows 10\nNext I switched to my roommates desktop running Windows 10 -- still nothing. p0sixpwn couldn't recognize the device. This was another iTunes issue.\nI installed a couple versions of iTunes but, no matter what I did, the iPhone wasn't showing up.\nAfter not using windows for ~5 years, digging through Device Manager and the Windows Services Manager were not gentle reintroductions. I threw in the towel.\np0sixpwn fork on MacOS 11\nWithout 32 bit support, the normal version of p0sixpwn doesn't run on MacOS 11. There is, however, a fork that does. Great.\nIt opens and detects my device but it's forked from an older base -- it only supports up to iOS 6.1.5...\np0sixpwn on a 2012 MBP running Yosemite\nThis was the goldilocks setup. I don't know why and I honestly don't care why -- this is an untethered jailbreak so hopefully I'll never have to deal with this again.\nCamera\nThe camera isn't really work discussing -- it sucks; I expected no less.\nHere are some sample shots:\n\n\nThis smudge is below the plastic lense\n\n\n\n\nThe Web\nWith all the javascript, jquery, and CSS 3 stuff on the modern web, most websites don't work. Those that do take a ludacris amount of time to load.\nThis website, notably, does work.\n\nApps\nNo App Store means no apps, I had to use this mtmdev to download them. Spotify, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, and GroupMe are hosted here. Perfect. \n\nInstagram\nInstagram works surprisingly well. Videos don't play, direct messages don't load, and there aren't any stories but the original idea of Instagram, a feed of square photos, works.\n\nTwitter\nTwitter works the best out of these apps! It's slow but that's what I want. The friction prevents me from idly checking it. If I need to check twitter, I can.\n\nSpotify\nI can log in but can't do much else. I suspect another API change. It hangs on this loading screen. Bummer.\n\nCommunication\nWhat this is all about -- can I text and call? Kind of. \niMessage\nI don't have any contacts so group chats are basically indistinguishable.\n\nThere aren't any fancy features like reactions or thread replies but that's not a big deal. On the basic level, I can send and receive photos, emojis, and messages surprisingly well.\nPhone\nThe phone app works great. Making and answering calls is what this phone is best at. It's more comfortable to use than a modern iPhone and it doesn't get into those weird states modern iPhones do.\n3G\n3G in Atlanta seems to be shutoff or maybe there's an issue with the MVNO service plan I use, tracphone. Either way, iMessage doesn't work when I leave the house... that's my 1 (one) requirement of a daily driver.\n\nText &amp; call forwarding\nI've gotten used to all SMS texts and calls forwarding to my laptop and iPad. When I'm at home, my phone is usually off somewhere but calls and texts still propagate to me via my iPad or Mac. I forgot that feature was introduced in iOS 9 and ended up missing a couple important calls yesterday... oops.\n\nConclusion\nIt's fun using this phone. I like the way it feels in my hand and how it fits my pockets. Making phone calls feels cozy and responding to messages is unobtrusive. \nThe fundamental issues that prevent me from sticking on this device are:\n\nno 3g: no data ~= no mobility \nthe camera\nthe lack of apps\nno contacts\n\nI really wanted to use this phone but with all these hurdles, I can't.\nI'll try and setup an iPhone 4 on iOS 7 and see if that smooths any of these pain points.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/the-iphone-3gs-in-2020/","title":"The iPhone 3GS in 2020"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/","title":"List of Projects"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/atuomata/":{"body":"Automata\nHack Charlotte 2019\nWe gathered data from multiple CSV files provided by 3 medical organizations (via a temporary ssh server) in the Charlotte health care system and visualized it.\nTo satisfy data security concerns, the data was further anonymised by normalizing the output through a local rust server.\n\nThe only conclusions the can be derrived from the resulting data are purely relational.\n\nData was overlaid atop Google's mapping API.\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/atuomata/","title":"Automata "},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/blackjack/":{"body":"Screenshots\n\n\nthe initial screen\n\n\n\nthe lobby before the game begins\n\n\n\ngame play\n\n\n\npost game chat\n\nInstructions\n\nrun manager.py\nrun client.py\n\nThe manager acts as the server, client.py is what each user should run.\nHitting return on initial inputs for both files uses default values that should set everything automatically.\nInfo\nManager.py\nThis file manages both the game and the server.\nAll clients are connected to the host’s IP address “127.0.0.1” through port 33000. The server is initialized and bound to that socket address and then connections are handled.\nThe exception function happens on another thread and is always listening for new connections. Once a client connects, they are greeted and added to the player array. Once they are added to the player array, attempt_start() is called to try and begin the game.\nEach player has a state (are they ready to play?), cards, and a socket address.\nOnce attempt_start is called, each player in the player array is checked to see if they are ready. If they aren’t ready (which can occur when they are waiting for other players to join), a message is sent to all the clients saying the game cannot begin.\nIf the game can begin, begin_game() is called. The screen is cleared on the client’s screens and the dealer begins to deal cards. The initial cards the dealer gives out is presented to the clients and the dealer’s cards are broadcasted to all. Once the game has begun, play() is called.\nOnce play() is called, the other players are told who is currently playing. The current player’s cards are dealt by the dealer and presented to them. They are then prompted if they want another card or not. Once the player declines another card, end_game_for_player() is called. When all players are done, end_game() is called.\nTo send messages to users, there are two functions -- send_message(socket, msg, prefix) and broadcast(msg, prefix). Broadcast goes through all the players and sends the same message out to all of them. Send_message sends a private message to the one player specified in the parameter.\nget_response(socket) is a function that is called when the manager expects input from the users. Previously this was always listening but to reduce overhead, this is only called when we are promoting a client for input. The message is received from the client’s socket with a buffer size of 1024 and decoded as utf8 (this way, we can have Unicode cards, flags, etc).\nClient.py\nClient.py is what each player runs. The host’s socket address is asked for (default values are provided) and then the client is connected to the server. On joined threads, send and receive is called. Sending takes any input from the user and sends them encoded as utf8 bytes to the server. The receive function is always running and decoding the messages from the server. If the message is invalid, the function returns. If the message is “clrscrn”, the client’s screen is cleared of all characters (this is good for formatting). If the previous conditions are false, the message is displayed on the client’s screen.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/blackjack/","title":"BlackJack "},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/hyperswift/":{"body":"HyperSwift - a HTML and CSS Generator\nMain Features\n\nVertical and Horizontal stack wrappers\nNative HTML Elements\nCSS Stylesheet generation\n\nCode Snippits\nHere's the code that generates this 500 page:\nimport HyperSwift\n\nVStack(justify: .center, align: .center) {\n  HStack(justify: .spaceEvenly, align: .center) {\n    Image(url: \"/images/error_bomb.png\")\n      .width(100)\n      .height(100)\n    Header(.header3) { \"HTTP 500\" }\n      .font(weight: \"bold\", size: 40, family: \"SF Mono\")\n  }\n  Paragraph(fiveOfiveMessage)\n}\n.backgroundColor(GColors.lightRed)\n.textAlign(.center)\n.margin(5, .percent)\n.display(.flex)\n.shadow(x: 20, y: 30, color: GColors.cardShadow)\n.border(width: 1, color: .black)\n\n\nCSS\nTo add CSS to the stylesheet, you have to call one of the functions defined in CSSExtensions.swift.\nIf an element has a class name, the styles will automatically be added to CSSStyleSheet.swift's stylesheet.\nCalling .generateStyleSheet() on CSSStyleSheet.swift will return a string containing the stylesheet.\nExamples\nHyperSwift is being used on garrepi.dev as we speak!\nCheckout the source code here.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/hyperswift/","title":"HyperSwift "},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/mytadata/":{"body":"mytadata\nA script for creating custom metadata\nWhen I scan my film, it's hard to manage the output.

Their documentation doesn't specify what media is acceptable but in the API, you specify media type by using MIME notation. I tried out a ton of these, thinking it was an easy way out, but only image types and video types are allowed.\nHow was it done?\nSo far, we know that you can only send URLs to the chromecast that point to images or videos.\nLet's solve the first problem -- URLs.\nTo send the chromecast a viable URL, we have to either have a domain or a local server. I don't have the former so I used the latter. I found swifter which is a great way to run a small server... although, their documentation could use some work. Because we're accessing the server from another device, we have to use the IP address as the URL (not localhost). There is no built in function for retrieving the iphone's IP address. So I used a C function to get the address from interface en0, the iphone's wifi interface. So now we have our URL to send the chomecast: http://IP:Port.\nOnto the next problem -- Media.\nInitially, I thought you could send any link to a chromecast and it would display. I spent a lot of time working on generating html pages with the correct font, color, etc. everytime the user updated text. I was half correct. A chromecast can display webpages but you have to register it on the development console. I paid the $5 and thought it would work. But there's an issue, you must provide a static IP address.\n\nAfter wasting $5, I knew the only thing I could do was send images or videos to the device. So I decided to take the text from the user, render it overtop of an image, save the image, expose the directory to the server, and send the URL of the image to the chromecast.\nA minor complication:\nWhen you connect to the chromecast and send the URL to the image (let's say the URL is 192.168.1.113:9080/files/renderedImage.png), it works great. When the user changes the text, the old image is overwritten with a new one containing the new text but same name renderedImage.png. But, after doing that, the url is still the same. When you send the url to the chromecast again, it will pull the webpage from it's cache (if you didn't disconnect to the chromecast). So all subsequent changes to the text wouldn't appear. To solve that problem, the image's name is no longer renderedImage.png; it is now renderedImage + a random number + .png. Now each update to the text sends a new url to the chromecast and everything works perfectly. However, with different file names, a user could end up having 100+ images saved to their phone because we aren't overwriting anything. To solve that problem, the directory is scanned before saving a new image. Every file found is deleted then the new image is saved.\nThat's it. The app works now on any device, anywhere.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/text-cast/","title":"Text Cast"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/tic-tac-toe/":{"body":"TicTacToe\nTry it out\nFollow the tutorial\nCheck out the source code\nAbout\nThis is the classic TicTacToe created in Swift using WebAssembly.

When you pause the timer, the overall time is calculated and displayed. This way is more accurate and efficient.\n\n\nTimer names are saved into UserDeaults and retrieved whenever the program starts.
