## mytadata

A script for creating custom metadata

When I scan my film, it's hard to manage the output. A quick trick I've done is set the date to 1970 so I can easily find all my film by scrolling to the bottom of my photos... this is not ideal.

With this script, I can set:

- name
- model of the camera
- make of the camera
- film ISO
- anything else I see applicable
