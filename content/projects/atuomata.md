# Automata

### Hack Charlotte 2019

We gathered data from multiple CSV files provided by 3 medical organizations (via a temporary ssh server) in the Charlotte health care system and visualized it.
To satisfy data security concerns, the data was further anonymised by normalizing the output through a local rust server.
  - The only conclusions the can be derrived from the resulting data are purely relational.

Data was overlaid atop Google's mapping API.
